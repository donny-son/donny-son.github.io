      <description>You can easily move downloaded files in Mac using Preview. When you download a .pdf file, the Preview app will popup displaying the content. When you hover your mouse to the title of the preview in the top panel, an icon will appear on the left. Then simply click and hold the icon drag it in to the desired directory(I assume that you have already opened the directory Finder).
  Other downloaded files unsupported by Preview can also be moved in a similar fashion.</description>

      <description>Recently I have decieded to change my default shell to fish. For the following reasons.
  Z shell was getting slower due to various packages that I rarely use.
  Wanted to keep a simple configuration file in my ./config folder.
  Did not want to spend time on configuration.
  Well, to tell the truth, zsh was blazing fast in my M1 macbook air, but on my other intel macs the startup time took 2~3 seconds, which was apparently the amount of time that can drive you crazy.</description>
