      <description>Recently I have decieded to change my default shell to fish. For the following reasons.
  Z shell was getting slower due to various packages that I rarely use.
  Wanted to keep a simple configuration file in my ./config folder.
  Did not want to spend time on configuration.
  Well, to tell the truth, zsh was blazing fast in my M1 macbook air, but on my other intel macs the startup time took 2~3 seconds, which was apparently the amount of time that can drive you crazy.</description>
