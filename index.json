[{"content":"Intro Over the past few years studying statistics, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a few tips and tricks with R and RStudio.\nImport multiple libraries at once Since R has some object-oriented goodness, importing multiple libraries all at once is possible in the following way.\n1 2  pkgs \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#34;ggplot2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dplyr\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;reticulate\u0026#34;, ...) lapply(library, pkgs, character.only = TRUE)   Also note that importing tidyverse package can come in handy.\nBackwards assignment with pipe(%\u0026gt;%) operators If you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with the concept of tidy data, you already know that the dplyr package supports backwards(?) assignment for variables.\n1 2  library(dplyr) iris %\u0026gt;% head -\u0026gt; iris.head   This comes in handy when you have multiple pipes.\n1 2 3 4 5  library(dplyr) iris %\u0026gt;% some.first.operation %\u0026gt;% ... %\u0026gt;% some.last.operation -\u0026gt; iris.cleaned   The Best IDE for R Personally, it\u0026rsquo;s hands down RStudio. I know other editors such as VSCode, PyCharm support R with various extensions. They are all okay, but none of those could not top RStudio. I just keep comming back to it. The code execution for Rmd files and the variable viewer, the default 2*2 grid layout just gives me some sort of peace of mind. I\u0026rsquo;m perfectly aware that RStudio is not the best editor in the development world, but at least it\u0026rsquo;s great just for R.\nI also use Neovim with Nvim-R. This neovim package offers a similarly satisfying experience as it supports variable viewer with great autocompletion as well.\nTips for RStudio Path Settings using Snippets For roughly 99% of my workflow, I store all my rmd, r, images, csv and .RData all under one repository. But, in RStudio the default path when you first send a command to the R console is not that repository. It actually points to your R kernel path. So, this means everytime you will have to manually copy the absolute link to your repository and setwd().\nLuckily, for us we can use snippets and RStudioAPI library to relieve the pain. Under RStudio Settings(Preferences) \u0026gt; Code at the bottom, you can see Edit snippets. Click and paste the snippet in your snippet file.\n1 2 3  snippet setpath current_working_dir \u0026lt;- dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()${1:$}path) setwd(current_working_dir)${2}   Then, everytime on top of your script, you can just simply type setpath and Rstudio will recognize this as your snippet and suggests completion. Hit enter and execute the two lines in your console. Just like that, your R console\u0026rsquo;s path is aligned with the R script path you are editing.\nThemes RStudio provides various color themes by default, but somehow I ended up not liking them all. You can actually add colorthemes from this theme editor website.   Fonts I recommend using ligature supported fonts such as JetBrains Mono or Fira Code. They\u0026rsquo;re all open-sourced and looks incredible when in the editor. Math ligatures can save you quite some time on debugging.   Python and R at the Same time I\u0026rsquo;m sure most of you heard that jupyter can run julia, python and r kernels. But, is it easy to use different languages cell by cell? Furthermore, can you share objects between those languages?\nThe reticulate library makes this possible. In the latest version of RStudio you can also handpick your desired python environment associated with the reticulate package. I prefer using a conda environment, so created one named ret and use this as the default interpreter for Rstudio.\nConclusion More tips and tricks will follow.

There could be a lot of reasons why you want to, or perhaps need to do this.\n  For personal use, you might have several machines that you would like to run the application on. For sharing purposes, there might be fellow colleagues who need to use the python application wihtout wanting to interact with the terminal. It\u0026rsquo;s also easier to distribute your program to multiple users. As shown in the attached video, launching the application is simple as double-clicking the custom-made icon. There\u0026rsquo;s no need for individual users to create a virtual python environment, install required packages and so on\u0026hellip;\nJourney It didn\u0026rsquo;t took too long creating my main.py, which consists of one function and one class. The m3u8Downloader class is the core element of this app. It inputs a filename and the url that ends with .m3u8 for each video content. The .m3u8 file acts as a meta data for loading short clips of an entire video. In other words, this is a instruction manual for reconstructing the entire video with short sample videos. I guess this is one way to stop people from easily downloading a video content to their local machine.\nNote that this downloader might not work with other platforms since they could all have different instruction manuals for their content.\nCore Libraries Two python packages were used in this app, requests and m3u8. As many of you know, requests package enables us to simply sends HTTP requests via python. The m3u8 package handles the meta data file and grabs all the child elements for you. So, my task was fairly simple.\n Make a custom parser for the m3u8 python package so it can successfully grab short clips. Send GET requests for the short clips. Merge the downloaded files into a whole video. Miscellaneous tasks such as creating a download directory and deleting all short clips after the merge.  GUI framework The last time I used a python GUI framework was to create an automated PDF extractor for medical reports. I used PyQt5, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy. Also, since it was merely a python wrapper library for the enormous Qt5 framework, the documentation was lacking certain features I value the most during development, docstrings. After some research, I ended up using pysimplegui, and it was absolutely amazing. The documentation was extensive, autocompletion was good, and it was so simple and easy to use.\nMy gui.py contains the GUI layout and the while loop for listening to events and the values of the user input. This was also very straightforward to implement by the PySimpleGui.Window().read() function. If a START event is initiated by the user clicking the START button, the m3u8Downloader from main.py is initialized with values from the PySimpleGui.InputText() objects.\nBuilding the app The building process was very tedious and surprisingly difficult. The pyinstaller command that worked for me was,\n1  pyinstaller --icon -icons.icns --windowed --name LearnusPy gui.py   The first obstacle for me was the icon. Initially, I just wanted my app to be an UNIX executable app without a GUI interface, since my app only asks for two string inputs and takes care of the rest. Also, this app was one of the reasons why I uploaded my tictronome package to pypi mentioned in my previous post. However, it turns out I could not overwrite the executable icon with my icon.icns. Also, Mac users should use .icns format as their app icon. .ico is compatible with Windows.\nSo that is basically why I made a gui.py. Just to use my weird little custom-made icon. Well we all have our obsessions for somethings\u0026hellip;right?\nSince, my app had a GUI now, the --windowed option was given, to tell the installer that we literally need a window for running our app.\nThe other obstacle was that my app, once built, had an unusually long starting time. This was because I was giving the --onefile option to the pyinstaller command. After removing that option, it loaded way faster. This was very interesting to me, considering that several stackoverflow articles regarding pyinstaller used the --onfile option almost like a default setting.\nConclusion The satisfaction after my first successful build was insurmounatble. It started with a small critical thinking like,\n \u0026ldquo;Hey, if we\u0026rsquo;re seeing some content on the browser, why can\u0026rsquo;t we download it? After all it is literally receiving data from the server which has no idea what we\u0026rsquo;re doing on our side\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.\n The entire process of actually figuring out that the intial hypothesis was true and building a solution to overcome the obstacle, it is pure satistcation and a bliss.\n","permalink":"https://donny-son.github.io/posts/creating-gui-for-your-python-app/","summary":"Intro Sometimes it is just nice to make a simple GUI for your python application.

Starting from the top, LICENSE file is a simple text file that contains an open source license. The MIT license is widely used.\nREADME.md should contain instructions on how to install and use your package. I personally recommend creating a separate readme file for pypi since it does not render images in my assets folder. For convenience I just used the same README.md file for my GitHub repo.\nassests directory contains images and resources associated with my README.md file.\nbuild/ is automatically created by running the build command.\npyproject.toml contains configurations of your build system, such as the version of setuptools required.\nsetup.cfg is the core configuration file. This will be a roadmap to your build. The .cfg file is a static config file. However you can also use a dynamic configuration file(setup.py).
